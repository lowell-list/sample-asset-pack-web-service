# Sample Code: Asset Pack Web Service

A server-side "microservice" that served up an appropriate asset pack .zip file based on client version and platform. If the server-side .zip file did not exist it was created on the fly. This idea proved invaluable because it made it easy to update assets for deployed, store-approved apps for specific versions / platforms.
